# Overview
This is a special version of a project that is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program of Udacity.

> In this project, making use of Python and Flask to create an app that explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Writing code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

* You should have Python 3, Flask, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).


# Project Details

## Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.


## Datasets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year


## Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

###  Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

### Popular stations and trip

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### Trip duration

* total travel time
* average travel time

### User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


# An Interactive Experience

The bikeshare_app.py file is set up as a ***web application*** that takes in inputs to create an interactive experience that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's inputs about city, month and day to analyze the data accordingly and display informative statistics. 

# Implementation steps:

1. You need to have python and the required packages installed.
2. Open a terminal and run the `bikeshare_app.py` file by typing this command: 'python bikeshare_app.py`

3. Then open the local host on any web browser like googl Chrome and start by selecting a city, month and day:

# The data comprises three csv files:
    1. [Washington data](./washington.csv) 
    2. [Chicago data](./chicago.csv)
    3. [NYC data](./new_york_city.csv)
