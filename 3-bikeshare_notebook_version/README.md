# Overview

This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program of Udacity.

>In this project, i will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. Throughout the project i will:
* Perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems
* Write code to compute descriptive statistics. 
* I will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help visualize the data.

This project is my very first exposure to the kinds of steps that a data analyst takes when they approach a dataset. The steps of the data analysis process that i went through here will be covered in more depth as i continue on with the Nanodegree program.

## The Datasets:
Three datasets curated from three cities, Washington, Chicago and NYC, for the bikeshare ridership data across one year.

## Technologies Used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlip
- Numpy
- datetime
- pprint
- Jupyter notebook
