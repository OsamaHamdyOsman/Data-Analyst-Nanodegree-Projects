## Prelude:

During the course of this Nanodegree, i got a great opportunity to acquire and apply many concepts of data analysis using python. Started out with a simple project - `bikeshare` data analysis project - which i have converted later into a web app version to learn flask as a new skill. Then i delved deeper into the Data analysis process and the data wrangling that consistute a sheer part of it.
